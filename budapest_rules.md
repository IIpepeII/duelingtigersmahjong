Only pungs, kongs and mahjong/hu declarations! No chows! 

Furiten is part of the game(details in the Special states and points section below). 

At the beginning of the game the players roll one dice. The palyer rolled the bigger number will be East(ot he dealer) in the a first round and the other player is West. East chooses a suit. Take out all the tile from this suit but keep the close and separated in a sack or faced down, mixed. The will have special role in the game.

2. (optional) West picks four random tiles from the non-playing suit pile without revealing them. Gives three to East. East reveals them and chooses two(if they are from the same number West can draw new tiles till East can choose from three different number). These tiles will be indicators for the optional points.
Put these tiles opposite of the dummy side. The unchoosen third tile go back to unwanted suit pile.

3. The unrevealed tile stays unrevealed. (more details about it's role are at the Treasure from the West section in the Special states and points section)

2. Current player chooses a dummy side action. 
    - Revelation(safe action): Reveal a tile from the dummy player's hand(13 faced down tiles). Only players in Riichi state can declair mahjong or kong on the revealed tiles.

    - Draw and discard: Current player draw a tile from the wall and immediatelly discard. Put  the tile in the dummy side's discard pile. Any player can declair any type of action for the discarded tile but in the case of two mahjong declaration the other(not hte drawing) player wins.

## Special states and points

### Riichi declaration and state – 2 Points
You can declair Riichi only with a closed hand.
After declaring Riichi, that player is only allowed to draw new tiles, check if it's a winning tile and, if not, discard that tile(no pung or kong declarations, only concealed kong is possible). The hand remains closed till the end of the game. If a player finds their last tile, they declare "Tsumo" and win or you can declaire Ron(mahjong on the other player or dummy's discard discard). Player who declaired Riichi can win by by robbing the last revealed tile in the dummy's hand. This is the only possible way to use those tiles in the game.

If the player declairs Riichi for a tile in furiten that means a valid mahjong declaration becomes impossible. The player in riichi state have to play the game till the end hoping the other player cannot declair mahjong.

### Only Bonus - Sets only with the numbers of the bonus indicator tiles(optional) - 3 Points

The player who only have sets and a pairs containing at least one tile with numbers of the indicatar tiles can have these points. 

### Treasure from the West (optional)- 1-8 Points

The first player who declaires Kong(if the first choose to not reveal the the next player who decalieres Kong) can reveal the faced down tile from the unwanted suit. If the treasure indicator is active, the player who declaires valid mahjong gets points from all the tiles with the same numbers(so maximum 8).
