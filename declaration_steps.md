# Simplified Explanation of Table 3: Types of Declarations in Sichuan Mahjong (SBR)

This guide breaks down each declaration type into simple steps for beginners. It follows the structure of Table 3 from the Sichuan Mahjong rulebook.

## 1. **Pung Declaration (from another player's discard)**

**When:** Another player discards a tile you can use to make a pung (3 identical tiles).

**Steps:**
1. Say "Pung!"
2. Put down the two identical tiles from your hand.
3. Take the discarded tile and place it rotated (to show who discarded it):
   - Left side = player on your left
   - Right side = player on your right
   - Middle = player opposite
4. Discard a tile from your hand.

## 2. **Concealed Kong Declaration (on your turn)**

**When:** You have four identical tiles in your hand.

**Steps:**
1. Draw a tile from the wall.
2. Say "Kong!"
3. Show all 4 tiles:
   - Place them face up, but turn the outer two tiles face down.
4. Take a replacement tile from the wall.
5. Discard a tile (unless you declare something else like another Kong or Hu).

## 3. **Promoted Kong Declaration (on your turn)**

**When:** You already have a melded pung (3 tiles from earlier) and draw the 4th identical tile.

**Steps:**
1. Say "Kong!"
2. Add the new tile to the existing pung.
3. Keep the added tile in the middle (no rotation).
4. Take a replacement tile from the wall.
5. Discard a tile (unless declaring another Kong or Hu).

_Note: Other players can declare "Hu" on this added tile (Robbing the Kong)._

## 4. **Postponed Kong Declaration (on your turn)**

**When:** You already have a melded pung and the 4th matching tile is still in your hand.

**Steps:**
1. Say "Kong!"
2. Take the 4th matching tile from your hand.
3. Add it to the existing pung.
4. Take a replacement tile from the wall.
5. Discard a tile (unless declaring another Kong or Hu).

_Note: Others can declare "Hu" on the added tile (Robbing the Kong)._

## 5. **Melded Kong Declaration (from another player's discard)**

**When:** Someone discards a tile that completes a kong for you (you have 3 matching tiles).

**Steps:**
1. Say "Kong!"
2. Put down your 3 matching tiles.
3. Take the discarded tile and place it rotated (same rotation rule as Pung).
4. Take a replacement tile from the wall.
5. Discard a tile (unless declaring something else).

## 6. **Hu Declaration (winning the hand)**

**Types:**
- **Self-drawn:** You win with a tile drawn from the wall.
- **From discard:** You win with another playerâ€™s discarded tile.

**Self-drawn Steps:**
1. Say "Hu!"
2. Turn all your tiles face down.
3. Stop playing; wait for the deal to end.

**From discard Steps:**
1. Say "Hu!"
2. Turn your hand face down.
3. Place the winning tile rotated and face up to show who discarded it:
   - Left = player on your left
   - Right = player on your right
   - Middle = player opposite
4. Stop playing; wait for the deal to end.
