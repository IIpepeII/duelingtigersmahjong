# Dueling Tigers Mahjong - Two Player Mahjong

Take out all of the flower and season(or joker) tiles.

Only pungs, kongs and mahjong/hu declarations! No chows! 

Furiten is part of the game(details in the Special States and points section below). 

At the beginning of the game, the players roll one dice. The player who rolls the bigger number will be East(the dealer) in the first round and the other player is West. East chooses a suit. Take out all the tile from this suit but keep them close and separated in a sack or faced down, mixed. They will have a special role in the game.

## Matches and points

1. A match is four or eight rounds(every player is East at least two or four times). At the end of the match, the player with the most points wins. 

2. In another variant players start with 30 points. The match also can end if a player loses all of their points.

## **Setup**

1. Choose any classic or homebrew rituals to build and break the wall. At the start of the round East needs to have 14 tiles in hand, West needs 13 and the dummy also needs 13 tiles but faced down.

2. (optional) West picks four random tiles from the non-playing suit pile without revealing them. Gives three to East. East reveals them and chooses two(if they are from the same number West can draw new tiles till East can choose from three different numbers). These tiles will be indicators for the optional points.
Put these tiles opposite of the dummy side. The unchosen third tile goes back to the unwanted suit pile.

3. The unrevealed tile stays unrevealed. (more details about its role are in the Treasure from the West section in the Special States and Points section)

## **Turns and steps**

### First round: 

East starts the game. Check if want to declare mahjong or Riichi(see Riichi state rules in the special points section), pong, or kong. Chows are not allowed. If not the discard on tile. Then continue with the dummy side draws written down in the next section... 

### Normal flow of a turn 

1. Current play draw a tile(from the wall or by declaration from others discard). If there is no mahjong or kong declaration the player discards one tile.

2. The current player chooses a dummy side action. 
    - Revelation(safe action): Reveal a tile from the dummy player's hand(13 faced down tiles). Only players in Riichi state can declare mahjong or kong on the revealed tiles.

    - Draw and discard: The current player draws a tile from the wall and immediately discard. Put the tile in the dummy side's discard pile. Any player can declare any type of action for the discarded tile but in the case of two mahjong declarations the other(not the drawing) player wins. 

3. The other player starts their turn from step 1.

## Going Out bonuses

### Self-Picked – 1 Points
Winning by drawing the final tile yourself from the wall.

### Going out on Kong replacement – 2 Points
Winning with a replacement tile after declaring a Kong (includes the point from the Self-Pick bonus).

### Robbing The Kong – 1 Points
Winning by taking the tile someone tries to add to a pung to make a kong.

### Concealed Hand – 1 Points
Winning with no exposed melds(only concealed kongs and pungs are allowed, discard win allowed).

## Special states and points

### Riichi declaration and state – 2 Points
You can declare Riichi only with totally a closed hand(no melded pungs and only concealed kongs are allowed). From this point onward the player is essentially playing on autopilot, and they cannot change their hand in any way.

After declaring Riichi, that player is only allowed to draw new tiles, check if it's a winning tile and if not, discard that tile. The hand remains closed till the end of the game. If a player finds their last tile, they declare "Zi Mo(cantonese) or Tsumo(japanese)" and win or you can declare Hu or Ron(mahjong on the other player or the dummy side's discard). The player who declared Riichi can win by robbing the last revealed tile in the dummy's hand. This is the only possible way to use those tiles in the game.

If the player declares Riichi for a tile in furiten that means a valid mahjong declaration becomes impossible. The player in Riichi state has to play the game till the end hoping the other player cannot declare mahjong.

### Only Bonus - Sets only with the numbers of the bonus indicator tiles(optional) - 3 Points

The player who only has a set and pairs containing at least one tile with numbers of the indicator tiles can have these points. 

### Treasure from the West (optional)- 1-8 Points

The first player who declares Kong(if the first chooses to not reveal the next player who declares Kong) can reveal the faced-down tile from the unwanted suit. If the treasure indicator is active, the player who declares valid mahjong gets points from all the tiles with the same numbers(so maximum 8).

### Furiten

### Types of Furiten 

- Discard Furiten

 You previously discarded the winning tile.
→ You cannot win on that tile if another player discards it.

- Passed Win Furiten

 You didn't declare a win on a tile that could have completed your hand.
→ You can no longer win on that tile if it's discarded again.

- Temporary Furiten

 A tile in the discard pool matches one of your waits, while you're in Riichi.
→ You can't win on any discard until your wait changes or you draw the tile yourself.
